Here's a poem on nature:

**Nature's Symphony**

The sun rises high and bright,
Bringing life to the world in sight.
The trees sway gently in the breeze,
Their leaves rustling with ease.

The birds sing sweet and clear,
Their melodies echoing far and near.
The river flows with gentle stream,
Reflecting the beauty of the dream.

The mountains stand tall and strong,
Their peaks reaching for the sky so long.
The flowers bloom with vibrant hue,
Filling the air with scents anew.

The wind whispers secrets in my ear,
Of the world's wonders, pure and clear.
The stars twinkle like diamonds bright,
A celestial show, a wondrous sight.

Nature's beauty, pure and true,
A gift to us, forever new.
So let us cherish and preserve,
This precious gift, sent from above.
